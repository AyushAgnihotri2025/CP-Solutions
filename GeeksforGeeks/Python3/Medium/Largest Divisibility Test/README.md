# Largest Divisibility Test
## Medium
<div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size:18px">Babul’s favourite number is 17. He likes the numbers which are divisible by 17. This time what he does is that he takes a number <strong>n</strong>&nbsp;and tries to find the largest number which is divisible by 17, by rearranging the digits. As the number increases he gets puzzled with his own task. So you as a programmer have to help him to accomplish his task.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Note: </strong>If the number is not divisible by rearranging the digits, then return&nbsp;“Not Possible”. <strong>n</strong>&nbsp;may have leading zeros.<br>
<br>
<strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input</strong>: n = 17
<strong>Output: </strong>17
<strong>Explanation</strong>: 17 is the largest number 
which is also divisible by 17. 
</span></pre>

<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input: </strong>n = 15
<strong>Output:&nbsp;</strong>51
<strong>Explanation</strong>: 51 is the largest number
which is also divisible by 17.

<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Your Task:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function <strong>largestDivisible()&nbsp;</strong>which takes n&nbsp;as input parameter and returns&nbsp;the largest number which is divisible by 17.<br>
<br>
<strong>Expected Time Complexity:</strong> O(|n|*|n|!), where |n| denoting length of n.<br>
<strong>Expected Auxiliary Space:</strong> O(1)<br>
<br>
<strong>Constraints:</strong><br>
