<div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size:18px">Consider a big party where N guests came to it and a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times was&nbsp;maintained. Find the minimum time at which there were maximum guests at the party. Note that entries in the register are not in any order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Guests&nbsp;are leaving&nbsp;after the exit times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:
</strong>N = 5
Entry= {1, 2,10, 5, 5}
Exit = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}
<strong>Output: </strong>3 5
<strong>Explanation: </strong>At time 5 there were 
&nbsp;            guest number 2, 4 and 5 present.</span></pre>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 2:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:
